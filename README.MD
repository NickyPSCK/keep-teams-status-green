# AlwaysGreen: Prevent Inactivity and Stay Active!

## Overview

The `AlwaysGreen` tool prevents system inactivity by simulating mouse movements. It ensures that screensavers, timeouts, or auto-lock mechanisms do not activate while the user is away or during specific exempted periods.

This script is helpful for:
- Preventing inactivity during long-running tasks.
- Avoiding auto-logout due to system timeouts.

---

## Key Features

1. **Activity Detection**:
   - Monitors mouse and keyboard actions using the `pynput` library.

1. **Timeout-Based Activity**:
   - Simulates activity after a user-defined period of inactivity.

2. **Exempted Periods**:
   - Define time windows where the system will not enforce activity.

3. **Modern Output**:
   - Optional colored and emoji-based status outputs.

4. **Customizable Settings**:
   - Timeout duration
   - Logo display
   - Status and exempt period visibility

5. **Real-Time Feedback**:
   - Outputs activity status in real-time, with optional colored text for better visibility.

6. **User-Friendly Command-Line Interface**:
   - Use command-line options to customize behavior.

7. **Keyboard Interrupt Handling**: Graceful termination with `CTRL-C`.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - The script initializes with customizable parameters, including timeout duration, status visibility, colored output, and logo display.

2. **Event Listeners**:
   - Monitors mouse and keyboard events to detect user activity and reset the inactivity timer.

3. **Mouse Movement**:
   - Moves the mouse and simulates a click to maintain system activity when no user input is detected.

4. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Runs indefinitely, alternating between monitoring inactivity and simulating activity.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python app.py [OPTIONS]
```


### Command-Line Arguments

|       Argument         | Default   | Description                                                                                 |
|:---------------------: |:--------: |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  --time                | 5         | Timeout period in seconds before inactivity action is taken.                                 |
| --classic              | Disabled  | Enable classic (non-colored) output mode.                                                    |
| --no-logo              | Disabled  | Disable the display of the logo.                                                            |
| --no-exemped-period    | Disabled  | Disable the display of exempt periods.                                                      |
| --no-status            | Disabled  | Disable the display of user activity status.                                                |
| --exemped-period       | None      | Add exempted periods in the format HH:MM:SS-HH:MM:SS. Multiple periods can be separated by space. Example: `--exemped-period 12:00:00-13:00:00 17:00:00-18:00:00` |

---

## Example

Run with default settings:

```bash
python run.py
```

Run with a 10-second timeout and no colored output:

```bash
python run.py --time 10 --classic
```

Run without displaying exempt periods or the logo:

```bash
python run.py --no-logo --no-exemped-period
```

Run with custom exempted periods:

```bash
python run.py --exemped-period 12:00:00-13:00:00 17:00:00-18:00:00
```

---

## Dependencies

- **pynput**: A library for controlling and monitoring mouse and keyboard events.
  - Install using: `pip install pynput`

---


## Exempted Periods

You can now define custom exempted periods either within the code or via the command line using the `--exemped-period` argument. This allows you to prevent enforced activity during specific times without modifying the script.

**Example (command line):**

```bash
python run.py --exemped-period 12:00:00-13:00:00 17:00:00-18:00:00
```

**Example (in code):**

```python
exempted_periods = [
    ('12:00:00', '13:00:00'),  # Lunch break
    ('17:00:00', '18:00:00'),  # Evening break
]
```

---

## Output Example

The script displays activity status dynamically:

Default Mode

```
| ENFORCED | Inactive in     5s | Status:ðŸŸ¡ |
```
Classic Mode
```
| ENFORCED | Inactive in     5s | #INACTIVE |
```
